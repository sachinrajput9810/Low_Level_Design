Welcome to the **Low-Level Design (LLD)** repository!  
This repo is focused on mastering **Object-Oriented Design Principles** through **Design Patterns**, complete with:

- ✅ Real-world examples 
- ✅ Java code implementation
- ✅ UML Diagrams

## 📂 Folder Structure


Each folder contains:
- `UML.png` – Class diagram for understanding architecture
- `Main.java` – Java implementation with real-life scenario

|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Singleton          | One and only one instance                   |
| Factory            | Object creation logic abstracted            |
| Abstract Factory   | Factory of factories                        |
| Builder            | Step-by-step object construction            |
| Prototype          | Cloning objects                            |

### ✅ Structural Patterns
| Pattern            | Description                                 |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Facade             | Simplify complex systems via one interface  |
| Adapter            | Bridge two incompatible interfaces          |
| Decorator          | Add functionality at runtime                |
| Composite          | Treat group of objects as one               |
| Proxy              | Represent another object                    |

### ✅ Behavioral Patterns

|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Observer           | Event-based trigger/notification            |
| Strategy           | Switch algorithms at runtime                |
| Command            | Encapsulate request as object               |
| State              | Change behavior based on internal state     |
